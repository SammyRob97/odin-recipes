This project is going to be a simple website that will give you some recipe ideas for dinner.

After this project is completed the skills that I will have show are as follows;
Being able to layout a basic webpage with a title and a header
Being able to link to different pages either with an absoulte link(A page that already exists on the internet) or a relative link (A page that you have somewhere on your computer)
I will be able to link to images and give them alt text to tell people about the image if they are unable to see it
